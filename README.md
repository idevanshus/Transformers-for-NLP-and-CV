# Transformers-for-NLP-and-CV
Welcome to the learning repository for the book "Transformers for Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, Third Edition" by Denis Rothman. This repository contains my journey, notes, and code implementations as I learn and apply concepts from this insightful book.

## About the Book

This book provides an in-depth exploration of transformer architectures and their applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). It covers essential transformer models, including BERT, GPT, Vision Transformers (ViT), and more. The book also delves into practical techniques like fine-tuning, pretraining, and real-world applications.
